# ImLiveYo
Twitch live notifications via Yo. Made at Dandyhacks 2015

## Installation

To install ImLiveYo, install Node and NPM if you don't already have them, then download this repository to your computer. Open a terminal, cd to the directory where ImLiveYo is located, and run `npm install` to get all the required dependencies. You will then need to get API tokens for Twitch and Yo, and fill in the appropriate fields in config.js. You can create a Twitch app [here](http://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections), and get a Yo API token [here](http://dev.justyo.co).

Once you have ImLiveYo configured, you can start the server with `node ./bin/www` from your installation directory.
